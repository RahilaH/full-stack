# Student Enrollment Management
Overview

The EMI Automation & Student Enrollment Management System is a full-stack web application designed to help educational institutes manage student enquiries, enrollments, and EMI-based fee payments in a centralized and structured manner. The system replaces manual and disconnected processes with a single dashboard-driven platform.

Problem Statement

Educational institutes receive a large number of student enquiries every month, but only a portion of these students finally enroll. Tracking enquiry-to-enrollment conversion, managing follow-ups, and handling EMI-based fee payments manually leads to inefficiency, errors, and lack of visibility.
This project addresses these challenges by providing a unified system to track enquiries, enrollments, dropouts, and EMI payments effectively.
